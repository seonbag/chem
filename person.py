# This project was me testing how inputs work
# I might add to this program and make into an adventure game.

name = raw_input('What is your name?\n') #asks for a name

print 'Hi, %s.' % name
print 'You know I always enjoy having you as a friend, %s' % name 

job = raw_input('What are you doing?\n') #asks for what that person is doing

print '%s sounds boring.' % job 
print 'You should do something more intresting than %s' % job 

age = raw_input('How old are you?\n') #asks for their age

print 'You are pretty old. %s is a year of regrets and lies' % age #asks for their age
print 'I want to go, you are bumming me out.'
print 'You are so sad'
print 'You seem to having nothing to live for in this life.'
print 'Talk me later. OK?'
